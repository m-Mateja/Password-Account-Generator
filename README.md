# Password-Account-Generator
Using Python we are able to generate randomized passwords based on their desired characters lengths. Pandas is incorporates to gather first and last names from an excel sheet, and convert them into random account names. These account names are then storred in a different excel spreadsheet, along with their corresponding passwords.
